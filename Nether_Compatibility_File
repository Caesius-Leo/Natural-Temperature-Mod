Hello there, in this file there are all the informations to implement compatibility with nether mods


In the config file there is the string "nether_compatibility": "total", if you leave it like that or remove total (leave "")
the nether will generate like the overworld (with bands) and modded biomes will spawn).
You can change it to "nether_compatibility": "default" to mimic the vanilla, so no modded biomes will spawn.

To implement the compatibility replace "default" with one of the following mod name on the right:

Better Nether = Already compatible, leave "total" or "" or "default"
Biomes O'Plenty = Nether not compatible, set "total" or "" to generate with bands or "default" to generate vanilla nether
Incendium = set to "incendium"

With time i will improve compatibility where possible
